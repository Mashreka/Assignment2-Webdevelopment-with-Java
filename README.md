# Web Programming Mini-Project: Servlets, MySQL, and GET/POST Handling

This repository contains the implementation of a mini-project focusing on learning web programming with Servlets, MySQL, and handling GET/POST requests. The project involves creating an HTML website with links mapped to Servlets on the server. Upon accessing these links, data will be read from/written to a database and displayed to the user in HTML format generated by the Servlets.

## Project Objectives:
- Create an HTML website with basic styling and navigation links.
- Set up the "gritAcademy" database in phpMyAdmin with three tables: "students," "courses," and an attendance table.
- Implement Servlets to handle GET and POST requests for various functionalities:
  - Displaying all students and their courses.
  - Adding new students and courses.
  - Associating students with courses.
- Ensure proper navigation links between Servlets and the homepage.

## Technologies Used:
- Apache Tomcat: for hosting Servlets.
- MySQL: for database management.
- HTML and CSS: for frontend design and styling.
- Java Servlets: for server-side processing and handling requests.
